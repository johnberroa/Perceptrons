# Perceptron Implementations
The purpose of this repository is two-fold:
1. Provide well documented and easy to read implementations of perceptrons for learning purposes
2. Create a generalized feed-forward neural network implementation that can be fairly customizable

To this end, there are three perceptrons within this repository:
1. Logic Perceptron
2. Cluster Perceptron
3. Multi-layer Perceptron

The logic and cluster perceptrons are essentially the same, but slightly modified to take different inputs.  The MLP is a standalone class that can take any vector of input and attempt to learn.

Any questions, comments, suggestions, please feel free to open an issue!
